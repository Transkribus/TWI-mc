cd TWI-mc
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 .

Make a file called `mc/settings/local.py` and add

```python
SECRET_KEY = '[somestuff]'

RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = ''
RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = ''

SERVERBASE = ''
STATIC_URL = SERVERBASE+'/static/'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1'] # or your local/dev server
    
# To display the version string and link to the appropriate milestone set the following:
VERSION = "My version String"
MILESTONE = "1" # or whatever milestone you are on/working to
```

With approprate values (The last two may need to override/reset the defaults that are `mc/settings/production.py`)

To set up and run (with the default django dev environment):

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py makemigrations utils
python manage.py migrate
# possibly add python manage.py migrate utils
python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py runserver [port]

```
